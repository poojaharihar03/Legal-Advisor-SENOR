## Existing Systems

- The legal landscape is currently characterized by scattered information sources, making it challenging for individuals to access comprehensive and reliable legal guidance. Court cases, Indian Penal Code (IPC) details, and other legal resources are spread across various websites, complicating the process of gathering relevant information.

- Furthermore, legal information is often laden with technical jargon and complexity, posing a barrier for individuals without legal expertise. Understanding the intricacies of legal terminology and navigating through complex legal documents can be daunting for many.

- Moreover, aspiring legal practitioners face unique challenges, such as pursuing a Master of Laws (LLM) degree, which requires navigating through vast amounts of legal literature and engaging with complex legal concepts.

- To address these issues, SenOR Legal Advisor consolidates legal information from disparate sources into a single platform, offering users a centralized hub for accessing comprehensive and understandable legal guidance. By leveraging advanced AI technology, our chatbot simplifies complex legal language, making legal information more accessible and digestible for everyone.
